    Information about Comb sort
    
        Comb sort is a relatively simple sorting algorithm originally designed by
        Wlodzimierz Dobosiewicz in 1980.Later it was rediscovered and
        popularized by Stephen Lacey and Richard Box with a Byte Magazine article
        published in April 1991. Comb sort improves on bubble sort. The basic idea
        is to eliminate turtles, or small values near the end of the list, since
        in a bubble sort these slow the sorting down tremendously.
