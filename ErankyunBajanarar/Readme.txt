Heloo.

     The demmand of the task is to find the number that has more than 500
     divisers.

     I solved the task a little bit diffrently. Insed of 500 you can insert any
     number you want.

The way of working:
    
    1 run the makefile by inserting $ make in terminal.
    2 run the Main.java file by inserting $ java Main in terminal.
